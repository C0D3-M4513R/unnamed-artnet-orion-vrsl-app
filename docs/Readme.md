Todo List:
----------
- [x] Make a working Fixture Ui, for adding fixtures in specific and channels
  - [ ] Allow editing
    - [ ] Allow specifying fixture variables
    - [ ] Allow replacing of one fixture type of an already added device for another
- [x] Make a Simple Channel control
  - [ ] implement by device view
  - [ ] Make that also serve as a monitor. Changes in the Simple Channel (editor/viewer would take precedence).
- [ ] Make ArtNet work
- [x] Implement Project loading into something else than the default egui store
- [x] Implement Project saving into something else than the default egui store
- [ ] Redo Fixture impl to allow for multiple different purposed (color) channels
- [ ] Figure out how to do/represent functions/scenes/chasers etc. in a blender-like nodegraph
- [ ] Make a working Fixture Builder
  - [ ] Allow Saving custom fixtures into the fixture store
  - [ ] Allow Customising the "path" they get saved to
  - [ ] Allow exporting/importing the fixtures

Other related Ideas that might fit well.
For now this is just a loose collection of stuff that might be cool to have.
I have spent no thought so far on how viable or not these ideas are.

Other:
----------------
- [ ] Allow to open panels as windows instead.
- [ ] Add a Timeline (sort of blender style)
  - [ ] Be able to add Music
  - [ ] Be able to add animations for most/all things
  - [ ] Be able to Save timeline with relative music paths and animations
- [ ] Add Visualizer (way out of scope for now. Maybe when everything else is done)
